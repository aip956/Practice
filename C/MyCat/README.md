# Welcome to My Cat
***

## Task
Create a program called my_cat which does almost the same thing 
as the system's cat command used in the command-line. It reads the 
content of each files which are received as an argument.
Unlike the real Cat command, it does not handle options.

## Description
1. Check if there is at least two inputs;
    a. First is the my_cat to run
    b. Second + are the files to read
2. For each file, 
    a. Open the file
    b. If it's null, return an error
    c. Read the file until it reaches the 
        end of file (EOF)
    d. Putchar the content (write)
    e. Close the file

## Installation
TODO - How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
